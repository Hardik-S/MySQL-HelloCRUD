# Description
This is my first full-stack project. I am using it as a learning experience. 

There are two main parts here, 
 - The Client, implemented using Axios for requests, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
 - The Server, implemented using Nodejs framework `Express`, mySQL, and CORS. 
  

# Conclusion
Overall, this helped familiarize myself with a full-stack environment. I am more confident with mySQL Workbench and understand how to implement CRUD operations using Axios in Javascript.
